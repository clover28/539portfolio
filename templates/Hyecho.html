			<h5>The Problem</h5>
			<p class="problem">How can we help visitors better enjoy a Buddhist art exhibit?</p>
			<p>	The Smithsonian Museum is seeking for an interactive app that enhances the visiting experience and attracts more visitors to their upcoming Buddhism-themed exhibition, Hyecho’s Journey. With insights from our research, we dropped the conventional digital catalog approach, and are aiming to create a game-like product that motivates users to explore the robust content. </p>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>This is an ongoing one-year client project where I collaborate with 6 other students from different schools. Our clients are seeking a mobile app for an upcoming buddhist art exhibition at the Freer &amp; Sackler Galleries in Washington D.C. They hope it can enhance the visiting experience, increase young people’s interest in Buddhist art, and have educational value beyond and after the exhibit. We helped clients prioritize their goals and aim to deliver a meaningful, enjoyable visiting experience with the product. </p>
			<h3>My Role</h3>
			<p>I am a UX/UI designer on a team of seven. I partnered with four engineers and two other designers to uncover user insights and translate concepts into features that address customer needs and pain points. I defined the product with my team and helped our sponsor prioritize their goals. I created storyboards, personas, app flows, and prototypes.</p>
			<h3>Defining the Problem</h3>
			<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
			<p>
				We looked into the existing apps for museums and exhibitions, and highlighted features including gamification, different ways of sorting objects, showing relationship between objects, and social interaction. 
			</p>
			<h4>User Interviews</h4>
			<p>
				We conducted 21 in-person user interviews and used the value proposition canvas to align user needs to our product direction. We found two pain points that need to be addressed: 1) many people do not see a companion app for an exhibit necessary; 2) many people associate Buddhism and art exhibit with being boring.

			<h4>Survey</h4>
			<p>
				To relieve the first pain point found in the interviews, we referred to users’ need of extra information and decided to add audio guide to the app. We conducted a survey on audio guide and received 32 responses. We found that 93% of the respondents find audio guide helpful in perceiving new information, and 75% percent of them have used audio guide. 
			</p>
			<h4>Data from the Museum</h4>
			<p>
				We requested a visitor study report from the museum, which contains 3 parts: over 1500 entrance-exit surveys, an observation study, and an interview study with over 70 interviews. We got robust information on the demographics and behaviors of the visiters, which helped us create our personas.

<!-- 			<p>
			To keep the visitors far from being bored, we started to consider what is intriguing about our content. The story of the exhibit is about a young Korean monk named Hyecho, who traveled throughout Asia in the 2nd century to visit places related to Buddha’s life. To give the feeling of a journey, we decided to have an interactive map that maps Hyecho’s journey and helps organize objects by location. In order to realize sponsors’ goals of gaining more publicity for the exhibition, the app will also have social media sharing feature.
			</p>
			<p>
			With these main design ideas, we prioritized product requirements with our sponsors. We decided to put the experience of visitors in the museum first, and realize the audio guide feature, map and journey, social media sharing, and gamified interactions with the object one by one in the order of priority.
			</p> -->
			<section class="paragraph">
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>
				From the journey map, we identified the two major pain points we need to address in our design: 1) No engaging story is provided to contextualize the exhibit for users; 2) No in-depth information about the artworks is provided on the museum labels. </p>
			<p>
				These two pain points corresponds with two types of visitor behaviors we found from existing literature: following a structured tour and freely choosing what to look at. 
			</p>
			<p>	
				Therefore, our app provides two options upon opening: 1) following a structured journey that ties the journey of Hyecho (the protagonist in the book our client is publishing and a central figure in the exhibition) to the exhibition; 2) browsing and searching for objects in an object inventory
			</p>
			<p>
				To engage visitors, especially younger visitors who are like our persona David, we design fun interactions that tells interesting facts about the artworks.
			</p>
			<p>
				To address the needs of both expert visitors and younger audience, we designed leveled audio guides that allow users to choose the type of content they want to hear.

			<h3>Process: Prototype, test, repeat</h3>
			<p>Throughout our design process, I created storyboards and prototypes for cetain features to communicate with stakeholders and test with users. We are currently making a high-fidelity prototype to test with users and museum experts.</p>

			</p>
			<h3>Challenge and Takeaway</h3>
			<p>Although I described the design process in a rather linear way, we did not follow a linear process because of various constraints. We have not and will not be able to go to the Freer and Sackler Gallery and did not get the information about the objects and the exhibit layout from our sponsors until very recently. </p>
			<p>However, the thought process is still the same. I empathize with users, ideate, prototype, and test. I have been able to think through the information I have in hand and pick the UX tool that can achieve our short-term goal most quickly. UX design does not always follow the perfect process, and I am learning to be adaptive to different contexts.
